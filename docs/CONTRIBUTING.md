# Contributing

Thank you for helping improve these textbooks. Keep mathematical-content changes
separate from repository maintenance whenever possible.

## Contribution workflow

### Reporting errors

Open a GitHub Issue for typographical errors, mathematical errors, missing
citations, broken references, or build failures. Include:

- the textbook and chapter or section;
- the source path or PDF page when known;
- the current statement;
- the proposed correction and mathematical justification.

Use a Pull Request for a focused correction after checking that an Issue does
not already cover it. Discuss a new chapter, major reorganization, notation
change, or shared-style redesign in an Issue before implementation.

### Development checks

Use the public `ashaiy` interface described in the [developer workflow](developer-workflow.md).
Before review, follow [Validation by change category](#validation-by-change-category).
For new or mathematically revised theorems selected for formalization, follow the
[Lean-first authoring policy](formalization.md#authoring-policy) and
[paired exposition format](writing-guide.md#paired-mathematical-exposition-and-lean-code).
Keep the checked proof, LaTeX label, exposition, and proof-index entry together.
Review [displayed-code correspondence](formalization.md#displayed-code-correspondence)
and mathematical fidelity explicitly; CI does not establish either.

### Pull requests

Follow the [local batch workflow](developer-workflow.md#daily-development-workflow)
for branch setup, synchronization, and cleanup. Submit a manageable batch in one
PR. Unrelated changes belong in separate commits; large or risky changes, or
changes likely to be deferred independently, belong in separate PRs. The owner
merges after the required GitHub Actions checks pass.

Run the checks required by [Validation by change category](#validation-by-change-category).
If a required check cannot run locally, explain why in the PR. Describe affected
books, validation performed, source or rights information for new material, and
any intentionally unresolved warnings. Do not commit build or dist output.

## Contribution policies

### Copyright and sources

- Do not submit text, problems, solutions, or figures whose copyright status is unclear.
- Cite external sources appropriately when they informed a contribution.
- Distinguish mathematical facts from a particular author's wording or exposition.
- Do not include lecture notes, assignments, examinations, or solution manuals that you do not have permission to publish.
- Confirm the source and publication rights of every new axiom, theorem exposition, proof, figure, and exercise.
- AI-generated material must be checked by a human for mathematical correctness, provenance, and licensing. Do not submit unverified generated results verbatim.

### Authoring conventions

File naming, labels, environments, and textbook prose conventions are maintained
in the [textbook writing guide](writing-guide.md). Structural ownership and the
generated-file boundary are defined by the [architecture guide](ARCHITECTURE.md).

#### Blank lines and end-of-file newlines

Use one empty line between semantic blocks and do not add multiple consecutive
empty lines for visual spacing. Language syntax and the configured formatter
take precedence when they require a different number of empty lines, such as
between top-level Python declarations.

Every text source file must end with exactly one line-feed character, with no
additional empty line at the end. Keep blank lines empty; the repository-wide
EditorConfig settings remove trailing whitespace except in Markdown, where
trailing spaces may encode hard line breaks.

## Task-specific workflows

### Starting a new textbook

Follow [Book structure and manifests](writing-guide.md#book-structure-and-manifests).
Review the generated sources and manifest record before enabling automation flags;
site publication settings and checks are documented in [Site metadata](site-metadata.md).

### Releases

Release eligibility and the post-merge publication procedure are documented in
the [developer workflow](developer-workflow.md#releases).

### Structural changes

Read [the architecture guide](ARCHITECTURE.md) before changing repository structure
or metadata. For chapter and section authoring, follow the manifest-driven workflow
in the [textbook writing guide](writing-guide.md#book-structure-and-manifests);
do not edit generated `book.tex` or `index.tex` files.

## Change classification and validation

### Change categories

Classify each change by its primary responsibility and keep unrelated categories
in separate pull requests or commits:

| Category | Typical scope |
|---|---|
| Mathematical content | One textbook's section sources, appendices, bibliography, and mathematically meaningful local notation |
| Typesetting and presentation | Shared styles and templates, book- and site-specific presentation assets, typography, and PDF behavior |
| Formal verification | Lean sources, proof-index entries, and the correspondence between formal declarations and labeled textbook statements |
| Repository engineering | Scripts, tests, CLI commands, configuration, CI, release automation, and site generation |

Change categories describe review ownership and rollback boundaries; commit
types describe the nature of a change. For example, a repository-engineering
change may use `fix`, `refactor`, `build`, `ci`, `test`, or `chore` depending on
what the commit does.

Classify a change by its effect:

- mathematical exposition and meaningful notation are mathematical content;
- fonts, spacing, environment presentation, and page behavior are typesetting
  and presentation; and
- release tagging, packaging, uploads, and their automation are repository
  engineering.

The file extension does not determine the category.

Separate changes when they have different review criteria, failure modes, or
rollback boundaries. In particular, do not combine mathematical revisions with
unrelated automation refactors, semantic edits with repository-wide formatting,
or dependency upgrades with new formal proofs.

Changes from multiple categories may remain together when they are necessary to
complete one coherent result. Examples include a theorem label with its Lean
proof and proof-index entry, a contents-manifest edit with the corresponding file
moves and generated assembly, and an automation fix with its regression test and
documentation. A useful test is whether reverting only part of the change would
leave the repository correct and meaningful; if not, keep the required parts
together.

Within mathematical content, treat each textbook as an independent change
boundary unless one shared typesetting change intentionally affects multiple
books. Validate shared typesetting and repository-engineering changes against
every affected textbook.

Use the following boundaries for cases that can appear to span categories:

- site generators, generated metadata, deployment code, and CI integration are
  repository engineering; site typography and presentation assets are
  typesetting and presentation changes;
- book-local presentation configuration is typesetting and presentation, while
  canonical toolchain, dependency, build, and automation configuration is
  repository engineering; and
- classify dependency upgrades as repository engineering, then choose `build`
  or `ci` as the commit type according to the dependency's consumer.

### Validation by change category

This section owns local pre-review validation requirements. Other guides and
templates refer here rather than defining additional blanket requirements.
Run the union of the applicable rows for a change that spans categories.

| Change | Required local validation |
|---|---|
| Documentation only, including book prerequisite policies | `ashaiy check source`; review policy meaning manually |
| Mathematical content or book-local presentation | `ashaiy format tex --check`, `ashaiy check source`, and `ashaiy book build --book <slug> --check --strict` for each affected book |
| Contents manifests, file moves, or generated assembly | Regenerate with `ashaiy contents generate --book <slug>`, then `ashaiy contents check --book <slug>`, `ashaiy check source`, and affected book builds with strict log checks |
| Lean sources or proof-index entries | `ashaiy lean check`, `ashaiy check source`, and affected book builds with strict log checks; apply content formatting checks when TeX changes |
| Python scripts or tests without PDF build effects | `ashaiy format py --check`, `ashaiy test`, and `ashaiy check source` |
| CLI or shell automation without PDF build effects | `ashaiy format sh --check`, `ashaiy test`, and `ashaiy check source` |
| Site generation or presentation without PDF build effects | `ashaiy site generate`, `ashaiy site check`, `ashaiy test`, `ashaiy check source`, and relevant Python/shell formatting checks; preview rendered site changes |
| CI or release automation without PDF build effects | `ashaiy test`, `ashaiy check source`, relevant formatting checks, and `scripts/check-actions.sh` for workflow changes |
| Shared styles/templates, toolchain/dependencies, PDF build infrastructure, or changes with uncertain PDF consumers | Both complete suites: `ashaiy test` and `ashaiy check all --strict`; also `ashaiy config check` for configuration changes |

The complete suites are independent: `ashaiy check all --strict` includes source,
formatting, Lean, and LaTeX checks but does not run Python unit tests. Full checks
build `check: true` books; `ashaiy book build` without `--book` builds `build: true` books,
while `ashaiy book build --check --strict` selects `check: true` books. If a shared change
affects a build-enabled book excluded from full checks, also run its explicit
`ashaiy book build --book <slug> --check --strict` command.

`ashaiy check source` runs ShellCheck at error severity and Bash syntax checks,
but no formatter or Ruff checks. Run applicable format commands separately.
`ashaiy check docs` is an optional fast preliminary check, already included in
`ashaiy check source`. It checks repository Markdown paths and heading anchors plus the
supported theorem-environment list; it does not validate external URLs or the
truth of prose. Review wording and factual accuracy manually.

Review rendered PDFs when a change can affect fonts, spacing, page breaks,
bookmarks, links, or other visual behavior. Shared styles and common templates
affect every build-enabled book; local frontmatter affects its owning book.
Documentation-only and CI-only changes without PDF effects require no local PDF
build. CI may run broader checks and conservatively build ambiguous consumers.
Explain any unavailable required check rather than claiming an unrun gate passed.

## Commit conventions

Keep each commit focused on one logical change. Separate textbook content from
repository maintenance, and separate formatting-only changes from semantic
changes. Include tests and documentation required by a change in the same
commit. Every commit should leave the repository in a buildable state and be
safe to revert independently. Never include generated PDFs, `build/`, or LaTeX
auxiliary files.

Write commit subjects in this form:

    <type>(<scope>): <summary>

Use a lowercase type and scope, no space before the opening parenthesis, and a
lowercase imperative summary without a trailing period. Keep the subject to 72
characters when practical. Use a body when the reason or impact is not clear
from the subject; explain why the change is needed rather than repeating the
diff.

Supported types are:

- `content` for textbook definitions, theorems, proofs, examples, and prose;
- `fix` for defects in source, tooling, or automation;
- `docs` for contributor and repository documentation;
- `refactor` for structural changes that preserve behavior and meaning;
- `style` for formatting-only changes;
- `build` for CLI, LaTeX build, dependency, and packaging configuration;
- `ci` for GitHub Actions and other continuous-integration changes;
- `test` for validation and test code; and
- `chore` for maintenance that does not fit another type.

Use a textbook slug or a stable repository component as the scope, written in
lowercase kebab-case. Use `common` for shared textbook resources and `repo` for
repository-wide changes. Avoid vague summaries such as `update files`, `revise
content`, or `misc fixes`.

Examples:

    content(mathematical-analysis): clarify the definition of uniform continuity
    fix(elementary-number-theory): correct the hypothesis of Euler's theorem
    build(cli): expose textbook commands
    docs(contributing): document textbook validation steps
    style(common): normalize latex source indentation
    fix(common): correct theorem environment spacing
    refactor(common): centralize title-page typography
    ci(release): validate tags against textbook metadata
